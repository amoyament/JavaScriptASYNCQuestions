//9. Return a Boolean if a number is divisible by 10
//Here, you’ll create a function that’ll give you a “true” or “false” Boolean as its output. The inputted number should only return a “true” if it’s divisible by 10. Otherwise, your program should return a “false” answer.

let num = 100;
let isDivisible10 = (number % 10 == 0);

console.log(isDivisible10);
